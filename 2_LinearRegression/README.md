# Simple Linear Regression — From Mathematics to Code

An end-to-end implementation of **Simple Linear Regression**, built both:
- with a **clean ML pipeline**, and  
- **from scratch**, using only mathematics and NumPy.

The goal is not just to *use* linear regression, but to **fully understand how it works internally**.

## 📌 What This Project Demonstrates

- translating mathematical formulas into working code  
- implementing regression **without black-box libraries**  
- correct train/test separation (no data leakage)  
- rigorous model evaluation  
- clear documentation of theory and implementation  

This is a **foundational ML project**, designed to scale into:
- multiple linear regression  
- logistic regression  
- gradient-descent–based models
